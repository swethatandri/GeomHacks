    var tip1 = "Spend some time alone. With your family confined under one roof, your previous outlets for personal time are probably gone. Make it a point to carve out some space for yourself, whether that’s taking a walk alone, practicing a relaxation technique, or winding down with a bubble bath.";
    var tip2 = "Prioritize your wellbeing. The lack of structure at the moment can make it easy to fall into coping mechanisms that can turn into bad habits, such as overeating, drinking too much, or abusing drugs. Added stress and uncertainty can also make it difficult to sleep at night. Try to prioritize your wellbeing as much as possible. This means eating healthy, getting in some exercise, and sticking to a regular sleep schedule.";
    var tip3 = "Don’t set yourself up to fail. Be realistic about what you can achieve. Do the best you can but try to keep some perspective. If you can’t bring yourself to set up that virtual museum tour or the kids end up eating cookies for dinner one night, don’t despair. There’s no guide to this, and everyone is taking it day by day. Try not to fall into the comparison trap, either. Each family has its own set of concerns and priorities.";
    var tip4 = "Reconnect with old passions. Think about hobbies you enjoy but rarely have time for. Maybe there’s a skill you’d like to learn, like knitting or making jewelry, but haven’t gotten around to yet. If you can carve out the time and energy, engaging in activities you love can help ease stress and add joy to your day.";
